## How to Run the Projects

Each project will have its own folder and instructions on how to set it up. Basic setup includes:
1. Install a local PHP server such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/).
2. Clone the repo to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project folder and follow the instructions in the project's README.md file for setup.

Stay tuned for regular updates as I continue to learn PHP and work on more projects!
